# Nike-Sneakers-Store


This repository contains the code broken into three sections: HTML, CSS and JavaScript which help me to build a Store App 
with an emphasis on the functionality of the shopping cart and other design elements.
I covered how to check if the document is loaded, and how to query the document for elements by class and how to add events to elements.
Combining all these techniques to make the shopping cart in the project work in an intuitive way.
